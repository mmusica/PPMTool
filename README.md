# Getting started
This site serves as a little project portfolio management tool
* 2 parts - FRONTEND and BACKEND
* For the backend:
  * Go to ppmtool folder 
  * Open terminal and run
   `docker compose up` for a new database
  * Also run `mvn clean package` for the compile 
  * Run the SpringBoot app!
 
* For the frontend (backend has to be working first)
  * Go to ppmtool-react-client
  *  Open terminal and run
   `npm install`
  * After that, run `npm start`
 
The website should now be accessible. Start by exploring the dashboard, and then try creating, deleting, updating projects, and managing project tasks.
